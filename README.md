# Glowroot Server

This project contains a Docker Compose file and friends to, using public images,
create a standalone [Glowroot](https://glowroot.org/) *collector* server.

While Glowroot is not a full featured [APM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool it is:

 - Simple to employ
 - Open source
 - Can provide a great deal of useful information within minutes
